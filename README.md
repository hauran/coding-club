# Welcome to Coding Club

Where we learn the basics of programming.

### What we have covered so far:

<br/>

- ## variable

  A variable is a symbol that represents a value.  
   Example:

  ```javascript
  var x = 3
  var y
  y = x + 2
  ```

  Both x and y are variables.  
   _what is the value of y?_
  <br/><br/>

- ## function
  A function is a set of organized, reusable code that is used to perform a single action. A function can haveparameters, which are essentially variables used in the function. A function can have no parameters or as many parameters as needed.  
  Example:
  ```javascript
  function addNumbers(number1, number2) {
    return number1 + number2
  }
  var y = addNumbers(1, 5)
  ```
  _addNumbers_ is a function. _number1_ and _number2_ are the parameters.

## Questions

- Looking at [this file ðŸ”—](https://github.com/hauran/coding-club/blob/master/src/App.js), what are 2 functions and what do they do?
- In the same file, what are some variables and what value do they represent?
- What can we add to make this app better?
