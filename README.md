# Welcome to Coding Club

We will be going over the basics of programming.

### What we have covered so far:

- ## variable

  A variable is a symbol that represents a value.  
  Example:

  ```javascript
  var x = 3
  var y
  y = x + 2
  ```

  both x and y are variables.  
  _what is the value of y?_

- ## function
  A function is a set of organized, reusable code that is used to perform a single action. A function can accept parameters which are variables used in the function. A function can have no or as many parameters as needed.  
  Example:
  ```javascript
  function addNumbers(number1, number2) {
    return number1 + number2
  }
  var y = addNumbers(1, 5)
  ```
  _addNumbers_ is a function. _number1_ and _number2_ are the parameters.
